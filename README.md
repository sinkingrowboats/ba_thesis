# The Honors Thesis of Samantha Rey
### An Introductory Survey of Randomized Graph Algorithms
##### Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Honors with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science at the University of Chicago

This thesis is the culmination of multiple independent study courses on the topic of randomized algorithms. This thesis is meant to give a basic introduction to a few randomized graph algorithms and analyzes the expected runtime of these algorithms under conditions of uncertainty. Although the paper is introductory, the reader is assumed to possess at least a basic understanding of probaility, linear algebra, and Big O notation, as well as a proficiency in the analysis algorithms.
